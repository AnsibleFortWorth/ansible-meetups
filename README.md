# Ansible Meetup Examples

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an IT automation tool. It can configure
systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as
continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

This is a repository dedicated to hosting examples and content that are a part
of the [Ansible Fort Worth Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Ansible-Fort-Worth)
events.

Anyone who is active in the Meetups is welcome to join the GitHub organization
and anyone anywhere is welcome to submit content.

## Ansible Community

Ansible Fort Worth is a local MeetUp group belonging to the larger global
[Ansible Community](https://github.com/ansible/community), specifically a part
of the [Ansible Outreach Working
Group](https://github.com/ansible/community/tree/master/group-outreach).

## Ansilbe Documentation

In the repository you will find plenty of information and examples but we always
recommend consulting the [Official Ansible
Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) as the source
of truth on [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) information.
